# Social-Network-Analysis
The Python code utilizes the NetworkX library to analyze a directed graph loaded from a text file. 
It reads a network structure from a file, constructs a directed graph, and then calculates various centrality measures for the nodes in the graph.
The code computes degree centrality and closeness centrality for the nodes in the graph.
It then visualizes the graph using matplotlib. Additionally, custom functions for degree centrality and closeness centrality are defined and applied to the graph.
The code demonstrates how to analyze and visualize network data, showcasing centrality metrics and graph visualization techniques.
